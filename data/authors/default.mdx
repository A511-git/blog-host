I am a backend-oriented full-stack developer focused on building **secure, scalable, and performance-aware systems**.

My primary experience includes designing REST APIs, working with relational and NoSQL databases, optimizing queries and indexes, and structuring applications with clean, modular architecture. I pay close attention to data flow, validation, and failure handling, and I prefer solutions that are simple, explicit, and maintainable.

This blog is where I document practical learnings around backend engineering — especially **PostgreSQL and MongoDB, databases, indexing strategies, system design concepts, and real-world trade-offs** encountered while building production-style systems.
